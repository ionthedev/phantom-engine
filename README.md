## Introduction
The Phantom Engine is a game engine aimed at making retro aesthetic games. Currently it's being developed along side [Fear The Crow](https://github.com/ionthedev/Fear-the-Crow), a quake styled shooter game.
Currently it does not have a GUI and won't have one for a long time. So in it's current state, it is a code only project.

## Libraries
Currently we are only using the following
- Raylib
- Imgui
- rlImGui

## How to Install
At the moment the repository is in being built, as is the engine. But when the time comes for it to be used, run the fun little installer application for your OS
